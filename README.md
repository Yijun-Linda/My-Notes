## The power of writing
You are a thinker, not a collector.
Write your thoughts down.

## ChatGPT
Since ChatGPT revolutionalizes the way we learn, I will use it to help me get better at explaining. First, I will ask ChatGPT to provide a few examples of how to use certain functions. I will ask ChatGPT to provide some examples and use cases. Then, I can get the feeling of it. Later, I will think about how to do it on my own. The key thing is to ask it to assist me and explain the concept to me.

## Review schedule
I found out that lots of people don't have good learning habits. The biggest challenge for any learner is to stop forgetting. How to learn effectively means how not to forget. The question is that we need to internalize things to commit to our long-term memory rather than reciting and forgetting after a few days. I have made mistakes like this for too long.

My review schedule is 24 hours -> 3 days -> 5 days -> 2 weeks -> 1 month;

## Output
I'd like to write what I learn down on my blog and LinkedIn and also record videos (<3m) for reasoning and public speaking skills.
