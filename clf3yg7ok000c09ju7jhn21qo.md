Financial institutions are grappling with the challenge of facilitating a transition to net-zero emissions, in the face of the urgent and pressing issue of climate change. The need to embed climate responsiveness throughout the entire lifecycle of financial products is becoming increasingly apparent, requiring practical actions that translate corporate-level goals into tangible outcomes for every business, product, service, and sector.  
  
The industry has developed a structured framework for decarbonization pathways. This strategic approach entails gaining a detailed understanding of the future barriers to decarbonization, enabling financial institutions to match anticipated needs with solutions, and identifying funding needs, duration, timelines, and collaboration needs. Financial institutions should consider the potential role of debt and equity, public and private financing, and primary or secondary markets in future solutions.  
  
At an operational level, financial institutions must undertake in-depth research to identify lending, investment, underwriting, and advisory solutions. This research will enable them to assess the environmental risks associated with their investments, and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.  
  
In short, the success of the transition to a net-zero emissions economy will depend on investing in sustainable and resilient solutions that will help to build a better future for all.
