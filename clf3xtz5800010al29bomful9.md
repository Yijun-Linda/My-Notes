As organizations increasingly prioritize sustainability, the finance function can use its expertise to support ESG reporting and disclosures.  
  
For years, the finance function is a well-established component in organizations and has been connecting operational and financial data and metrics. Today, it can replicate these processes through a sustainability lens, such as asset amortization, and quantify the impact of climate disruption on the P&L.  
  
By adding a sustainability lens to existing processes and decision-making events and possessing the necessary data and skill sets, finance can help drive the allocation of capital towards sustainable initiatives and predict the ROI of such efforts whether through lowered energy costs, carbon abatement, or increased productivity and revenue.  
  
Consequently, It is an effective way of adding a new layer of sustainability, rather than treating it as a separate matter, to the decision-making.
