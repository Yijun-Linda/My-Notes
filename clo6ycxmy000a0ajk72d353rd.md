\- Conducted research to identify the most suitable material for machine casting and performed feasibility analyses and tests using metal sheets for construction (plastic granules: Acrylic, PVC, and PP).  
\- Integrated system design approaches (TRIZ, QFD) and developed practical solutions.  
\- Cost Analysis: Created financial modelling, devised marketing strategies and conducted cost analyses for the design and business operations.
