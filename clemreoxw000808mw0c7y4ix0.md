The practice of greenwashing poses a significant peril to investors, as it can skew their evaluations of a company's sustainability record and influence their investment choices. Some companies engage in greenwashing to make themselves appear more sustainable than they actually are.  
  
To address this pressing issue,Â [Stephan Geiger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABcAO0sBVLgQHWV-chLUpAQEn3R14DW4t_E) has offered two key questions to guide investors' thinking when it comes to risk management within sustainable finance.  
  
One is centred around the identification, assessment, and management of sustainability-related risks. This involves a comprehensive examination of the various environmental, social, and governance factors that may impact a company's sustainability performance. Another pertains to the measurement and monitoring of risks associated with sustainability.
