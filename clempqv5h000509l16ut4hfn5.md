Integrating sustainability monitoring into the core services of transaction banking can yield significant benefits in enhancing a company's ESG performance.  
  
Currently, banks frequently package sustainable finance products with conventional lending products, yet there is a dearth of industry-wide norms that can effectively evaluate dependable data and assessments concerning a company's sustainability practices.  
  
To address this challenge, the next phase would involve developing a more comprehensive supply chain ecosystem, namely, a sustainable supply chain finance platform that can assess the sustainability of the entire supply chain. This platform would use internal Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and external evidence obtained from a third-party sustainability rating agency to quantifiably measure a participant's ESG status across multiple domains, including the environment, human rights, labour practices, and sustainable procurement.
