Hello World!

ðŸ‘‹Hi there! I'm Linda (Yijun). I publish a daily post and a weekly newsletter on Sustainability, especially with ideas on Sustainable Finance.

It is with a sense of purpose and determination that I embark on a daily experiment of sharing my thoughts on the issue of sustainability. I have been resolving to make it a point to voice my musings and reflections on this matter every working day or every day as I study MSc Management and Corporate Sustainability at [Cranfield School of Management](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cranfieldschoolofmanagement/).  
  
The seed of this resolution was planted in my mind by a simple, yet insightful question, too many reading instead of writing something down and sharing with others. It was this realization that motivated me to launch this experiment, with the hope of inspiring thought and sparking a conversation about [#sustainability](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=sustainability&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7030229909226573824).
