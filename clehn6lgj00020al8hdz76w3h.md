The difficulty in integrating ESG and sustainability into core business practices, especially in developing countries, is a complex issue rooted in the underlying structure of the economy and the survival instincts of companies. üßê  
  
Take, for instance, China's situation. Due to its large population, industrialization is the only viable path to survival. The harsh realities of low-profit margins, intense competition, and a lack of trust in the private sector have left many Chinese companies struggling at the bottom of the global industrial chain.  
  
In contrast, developed economies such as Europe and the United States benefit from a higher position in the industrial chain, allowing companies to prioritize ESG and sustainability due to their stability and prosperity. This translates to more resources, respect, and rewards for employees, and a greater ability to incorporate sustainable practices into their business models.  
  
Therefore, it is crucial that we approach this issue with a comprehensive understanding of the economic and structural factors involved, rather than seeking standardised solutions.
