The association between ESG performance and financial performance has been the subject of considerable examination, yet the causal link between the two remains a subject of debate. Moreover, a consensus has yet to emerge on the means of measuring and incorporating ESG factors into investment decision-making.  
  
In the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's abandonment of its accommodative monetary policy, interest rates surged, resulting in the exposure of the capital misallocation engendered by the ESG movement and the distortion it wrought on the investment climate under the impact of the most aggressive interest rate hike in 40 years.  
  
Cliff Asness has suggested that ESG investing may lead to reduced returns, as investors may avoid companies with strong profit potential in the short term but weaker ESG standards.
